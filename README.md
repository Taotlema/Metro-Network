# Metro-Network
Social network commodity exhange system.

## About the Project
This is a research project that I made with the High Performing Computing Systems Lab at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Which was apart of the Undergraduate Research Intiaitive. Metro-Network is a data visualization project that uses Social Netowrks in order to map out commdity exhanges trends within the United States and particularly, North Carolina. The data used for this research would be collected from the United States Census Beareu's 2017 Commodity Flow Survey Dataset. I would then create python scirpts to read through the data, and map out social networks using Python Libraries, NetworkX, and Matplotlib.

## Project Usage and Installation
In the github, you can view the code used to visualize a CSV file provided by the afromentioned Commodity Flow Survey which can be accessed in the link provided below.
**2017 Commodity Flow Survey:** census.gov/data/datasets/2017/econ/cfs/historical-datasets.html

It is possible to use the code provided to generate network graphs graphs locally, however, github cannot support the large CSV file that the scirpt read through, and so they will need to be downloaded, locally aswell, and have the file addresses in the code adjusted accordingly. 

## Development Tools and Libraries
- Pycharm
- Network X
- Matpoltlib
