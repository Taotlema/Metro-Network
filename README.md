# Metro-Network
Social network commodity exhange visualization

## About the Project
This research project was conducted in collaboration with the High-Performance Computing Systems Lab at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte as part of the Undergraduate Research Initiative. Metro-Network is a data visualization project that leverages social networks to map commodity exchange trends across the United States, with a particular focus on North Carolina. The data for this research was sourced from the United States Census Bureau's 2017 Commodity Flow Survey Dataset. I developed Python scripts to process this data and used libraries such as NetworkX and Matplotlib to create social network visualizations.

## Project Usage and Installation
On the GitHub repository, you can find the code used to visualize a CSV file from the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey, accessible through the following link:
**2017 Commodity Flow Survey** census.gov/data/datasets/2017/econ/cfs/historical-datasets.html
While the provided code allows for generating network graphs locally, the large CSV file required for the script cannot be hosted on GitHub. Therefore, you will need to download the CSV file locally and update the file paths in the code accordingly. 

## Development Tools and Python Libraries
- Pycharm Community Edition 2023.3.3
- Network X
- Matpoltlib
